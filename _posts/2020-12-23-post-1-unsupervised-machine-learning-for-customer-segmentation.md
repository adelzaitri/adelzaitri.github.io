What
======
This is part of the #66daysofdata challenge. The challenge consists of an emersion into data and Data Science related projects throughout the next 66 days.

For day 2, I worked on a project that focuses on extracting insights related to bank customers and clustering the customers into different segments. The work is part of the guided project on Coursera.

The code for the project could be found in my Github repository : 
[unsupervised-machine-learning-for-customer-segmentation](https://github.com/adelzaitri/unsupervised-machine-learning-for-customer-segmentation) 

Why
======
The business objective is to divide the customers into segments that could be reached out to with different marketing campaigns.

The obtained results are 5 clusters.

Project Objectives
===========
* Understand how to leverage the power of machine learning to transform marketing departments and perform customer segmentation
* Apply Python libraries to import and visualize dataset images.
* Understand the theory and intuition behind k-means clustering machine learning algorithm
* Learn how to obtain the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method
* Apply Scikit-Learn library to find the optimal number of clusters using elbow method
* Apply k-means in Scikit-Learn to perform customer segmentation
* Understand the theory and intuition behind Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm
* Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to perform dimensionality reduction and data visualization
* Compile and fit unsupervised machine learning models such as PCA and K-Means to training data

How: Project Tasks
===========

* Task 1: Understand the problem statement and business case    
* Task 2: Import libraries and datasets    
* Task 3: Visualize and explore datasets    
* Task 4: Understand the theory and intuition behind k-means clustering machine learning algorithm

* Task 8: Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to perform dimensionality reduction and data visualization  


Exploratory Data Analysis
===========
Various steps were performed to clean the data, an example of the steps is the heatmap of the correlations between the different features:
