In this paper, the fatigue strength in multidirectional (MD)/unidirectional (UD) composite laminates of wind turbine blades is predicted using particle swarm optimization-based artificial neural networks (PSO-ANN). In the PSO-ANN approach used in this work, the objective function was assessed using the mean square error (MSE) computed as the squared difference between the predicted values and the target values. Different materials based on different reinforcing fabrics and resins are compared in terms of the maximum tensile fatigue stress. Tensionâ€“tension constant amplitude fatigue loads were applied to thermoset materials including glass-fiber/epoxy, polyester and vinyl esters. All materials were treated in closed molds with resin infusion process, which were molded into their final dogbone shape without machining. The results show that the PSO-ANN can provide accurate fatigue strength prediction for different MD/UD composite laminates under different values of fiber orientation
